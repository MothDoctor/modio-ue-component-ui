Welcome to the mod.io Unreal Engine Component UI repository. The Component UI plugin provides UI components, a template Mod Browser, and editor tooling to allow UE developers to rapidly implement mod.io-aware mod browsing and other elements into their game's UI.  
It can be added either directly into existing screens or in dedicated browser and discovery sections.  

== Engine & Platform Compatibility

This plugin requires the core mod.io plugin to be installed alongside it. Support for both plugins is generally maintained to support the 3 most recent versions of Unreal Engine. 
=== Engine compatibility

|===
|Engine Version | Last Release
|UE5.2 | Current
|UE5.3 | Current
|UE5.4 | Current
|===


== Features

* UI-focused subsystem easing communication between UI elements and the core plugin
* Default UI component implementations that utilize the subsystem and visualize common mod.io data structures
* Interfaces and specifications to allow you to implement your own compliant components
* Template/reference implementation of a mod browser suitable for use as the basis of your own UI
* Permissive MIT/BSL-license
